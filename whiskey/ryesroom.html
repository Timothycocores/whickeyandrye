  <h1>Rye's Room</h1>
</div>
<p>When decorating your new childs room there are a lot of things to consider. These things are safety, design,functionaliy, and essentials. I know that this is probably a given that these things are all something to be considered. As one of those dads that have not read blogs, articles or even watched a video of what to do for a design I can tell you the thought process that goes into this blank slate can be a bit overwhelming. 
<br>
<br>
One of the major things you need to conside when decorating your childs room which I discovered through trial and error is SAFETY. Just because something looks awesome and you would put it in your room doesn't mean that it's safe enough to be put into your childs room. I learned this by having a specific dresser in mind that I wanted to put into our Rye's room however the dressers were recalled by Ikea as they were a tipping hazard and had the potential of crushing small children. You can read more about this recall from the link <a href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/about_ikea/newsitem/062816-recall-chest-and-dressers">here</a> if you want to see which furniture items have been recalled and if you have any of these and get them returned.

  <h1>Furniture Choices</h1>
</div>
<p>We chose all of our furniture from Ikea because like most of you we like reasonably priced furniture with a mimalist design. We decided against doing a traditional changing table and picked something with more storage. We opted for the expedit cube shelf which allows for 8 cubbies to place either drawers or boxs in to optimize our storage and how a fun look. </p>

<p>We chose how to decorate the room based on the JPL (Jet Pupulsion Labs) posted NASA was offering as a free download. You can find these <a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/visions-of-the-future/">here</a> The two images we chose to print are pictured below.</p>

</div>
<br>
<p>We printed thes 27 x 20 and placed them in frames we got from Ikea. The nice thing about the frames are that Ikea started using plastic instead for glass in their frames which makes this a safer option for the room, in case these happen to get a toy thrown at them or some how fall off the wall. The prints them self would have been expensive to print but we were able to get these printed on the large scale plotter at my job which helped to cut down on the cost. For mounting the pictures to the wall we decided to use Command Strips which can hold up to 15 pounds. The reason we chose this over using a wire and nail method is because this secures the frame to the wall more making harder to get pulled off the wall.</p>

<p>Since we did not want to take away from the focus of the room which was the Nasa prints we decided to keep everything fairly simple and clean. We chose a simple color way to use in the room, lot's of whites and natural wood to keep this simple and make the room feel bright. The crib we chose was a simple convertible natural wood crib with no design really to it to keep with the simplicity of the room.</p>
